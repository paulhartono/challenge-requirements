# Grocery Store
A grocery store needs to prepare updates for two systems every night at 12:00 AM. The systems consume data in their own proprietary formats, one is already generated and needs to be updated and the other needs to be manually generated.

The first system is used for stock ordering. It needs to know how many products have been consumed throughout the day so that it can generate orders for the store. This data is formatted as XML.

The second system is used for promotions to customers. It needs to know what products each customer purchased. It will only receive information about customers who used their customer loyalty card when ordering. This data is formatted as JSON.

The orders for the day are available in a CSV. Each order contains the order ID, department, product & customer ID (if available).

## Data Input
- [Customers.json](./data/Customers.json)
- [Orders.csv](./data/Orders.csv)
- [Stock.xml](./data/Stock.xml)


# Challenge
## Part 1: Customer Order Grouping
For each customer that made a purchase on the day, group any orders together by their customer ID only including the products purchased & the quantity of each product purchased.

Do not include any orders that did not include a customer ID.

Write this JSON output to a file named `summaries/GroupedOrders.json`.

Treat the Customers.json file like a database â€” not all customers in the Customers.json file would have made a purchase that day, and when reading from the file consider memory efficient approaches.

## Part 2: Updating Stock
The `Stock.xml` file includes the quantity of each item purchased that day & it is incorrect until updated from today's orders. For each order, update the corresponding quantities in the Stock.xml file.

Remove any duplicates & add products if they do not exist.

The updated Stock should be output to `summaries/Stock.xml`.
