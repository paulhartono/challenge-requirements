# Address Book Coding Challenge
Your mission if you choose to accept it is to build an address book that allows a user to store
the name and phone numbers of their friends, with the following functionality:

- To be able to display the list of friends and their corresponding phone numbers
sorted by their name

- Given another address book that may or may not contain the same friends, display
the list of friends that are unique to each address book.

For example given:
```
Book1 = { “Alice”, “Bob”, “Charlie” }
Book2 = { “Bob”, “Doug”, “Charlie” }
```
The friends that are unique to each address book is:
```
Book1 \ Book2 = { “Alice”, “Doug” }
```

Please provide relevant source code of your implementation, any documentation and list any
assumptions that you feel are appropriate. Please use the following information to assist you
completing this challenge successfully:

- The intent of the challenge is to provide us with an opportunity to judge your problem
solving, design and development skills.
- It is important to provide a solution that highlights your skills in these areas,
preferably using the technologies and tools outlined in the position description.
- It is also important that your solution highlights your knowledge of and approach to
Agile software development.
- The simplest solution is often the best. It is recommended that no more than 4 - 8
hours is spent on the problem, as a sufficient working program can be achieved in
that time period.
- The application must run and be easy to build from source. It also must be easy to
execute for us to determine if the application meets the above requirements
